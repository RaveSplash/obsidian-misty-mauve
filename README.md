## Misty Mauve

This is my first theme and also my first time learning some CSS, hope you guys like my design.
There's still alot of things i want to try, so please bear with me and i will deliver ASAP.

The color palette is characterized by subtle and muted tones, blending the gentle grays of Timberwolf and Bright Gray with the delicate warmth of Tulip giving a chill vibes when you are making your notes.

And here's a song with the same title as the theme https://youtu.be/BgtHQtKSizw.
